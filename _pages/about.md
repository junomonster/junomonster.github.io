<h2 style="font-weight:300">We are a young cybersecurity R&D startup based in Austin, TX.</h2>

<div markdown="1">
### We are _hackers_.

Theori was founded by a team of hackers from Carnegie Mellon University who have conquered DEFCON CTF five times and many other international competitions.
Difficult problems excite us: we love to tackle challenges with novel, innovative, and effective solutions.


### We are _versatile_.

Over many years we have expanded our expertise to range from vulnerability research to automotive security.
We work with both commercial and government customers to improve the security of their infrastructure and provide an outside perspective.
Our performance is _world-class_: we provide practical and actionable solutions, consulting and penetration testing, and government R&D contracts.


### We are _open_.

We benefit from amazing security communities and we would like to contribute, too.
Our researchers have given talks and trainings at international conferences, and we plan to make them more accessible.
Stay tuned to our blog for new research, slides, and more!
